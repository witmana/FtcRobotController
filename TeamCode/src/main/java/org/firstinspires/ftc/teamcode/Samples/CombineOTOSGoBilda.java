/*
This opmode shows how to use the goBILDAÂ® Pinpoint Odometry Computer.
The goBILDA Odometry Computer is a device designed to solve the Pose Exponential calculation
commonly associated with Dead Wheel Odometry systems. It reads two encoders, and an integrated
system of senors to determine the robot's current heading, X position, and Y position.

it uses an ESP32-S3 as a main cpu, with an STM LSM6DSV16X IMU.
It is validated with goBILDA "Dead Wheel" Odometry pods, but should be compatible with any
quadrature rotary encoder. The ESP32 PCNT peripheral is speced to decode quadrature encoder signals
at a maximum of 40mhz per channel. Though the maximum in-application tested number is 130khz.

The device expects two perpendicularly mounted Dead Wheel pods. The encoder pulses are translated
into mm and their readings are transformed by an "offset", this offset describes how far away
the pods are from the "tracking point", usually the center of rotation of the robot.

Dead Wheel pods should both increase in count when moved forwards and to the left.
The gyro will report an increase in heading when rotated counterclockwise.

The Pose Exponential algorithm used is described on pg 181 of this book:
